	Short: "Documentation management CLI tool",
	Long: `Rex is a fast, SQLite-backed documentation management tool.

Rex helps you manage:
  • Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  • RFCs (Requests for Comments)
  • Tasks with relationships and time tracking
  • Plans and roadmaps

All documents are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter,
and cached in SQLite for lightning-fast queries and filtering.

Common commands:
  rex adr create "Decision Title"       # Create an ADR
  rex rfc create "Proposal Title"       # Create an RFC
  rex task create                       # Create a task (interactive)
  rex task list --type core --status in_progress
  rex plan create "Q4 Roadmap"         # Create a plan
  rex rebuild                           # Rebuild cache from markdown

For help with a specific command:
  rex <command> --help
