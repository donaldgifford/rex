## Context and Problem Statement

A tool for managing and creating ADR's(Architecture Decision Records). I wanted
a simple way to create markdown files with templates that allow for some
configuration and is easy to use.

## Decision Drivers

There's a bunch of stuff out there but none that worked the way I wanted, so
here's another tool.

## Considered Options

Until something like
[Oxide's RFD tooling](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/rfd-site) is around, not
worth messing with much else. Maybe change to support asciidoc eventually, idk.

## Decision Outcome

Make it myself until better options come out
